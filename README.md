Created for Kode With Klossy's Data Storytelling Challenge to work with data from partner organization, Black Wealth Data Center, to craft a compelling, data-driven visual narrative
Chosen as **one of three finalists** for the **Built for Everyone: Most Accessible Piece** award. *Recognizes a project that puts accessibility first through clear language, inclusive design, and thoughtful data presentation.*

*All images, data sources, and testimonies are cited.*

Inspiration:
- [Kode With Klossy Scrollytelling Template](https://github.com/jasminesamra/kwk-scrollytelling-template)
- [Wata Na Life](https://www.wateraid.org/uk/stories/water-is-life-in-sierra-leone)
- [The Economic Impact of Closing the Racial Wealth Gap](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-sector/our-insights/the-economic-impact-of-closing-the-racial-wealth-gap)
I admired the simplicity of text, font, image, color, and transition choices, which was my goal to achieve in this project.
