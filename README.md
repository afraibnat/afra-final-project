I utilized the “Kode With Klossy Scrollytelling Template” repository code to create this project.

This project was inspired by the “Wata Na Life” and “The Economic Impact of Closing the Racial Wealth Gap” websites, both scrollytelling websites. I admired the simplicity of text, font, image, color, and transition choices, which was my goal to achieve in this project.
